# eslint-config-presets

> Happy coding using multiple config of eslint.

## Try it

```bash
# depedencies: eslint babel-eslint
npm install --save-dev eslint babel-eslint

# install from this repository
npm install --save-dev arzyu/eslint-config-presets
```

Create a eslint config file (e.g. `.eslintrc.yml`) on top level of your project.

```yaml
---
# Note: `presets` is a shorthand of `presets/default`
# You can also use other preset. (e.g. `presets/fashion`)
extends: presets
```

## Fork it

These are mine config files. They may not meet all your specific needs.
I recommend you **fork** it and do the appropriate adjustments to fit your needs.
